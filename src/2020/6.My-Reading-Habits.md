>译者注：这是我无意中看到的一个大佬写的关于阅读的总结。纵观这位技术前辈的近一年的博客文章，可以看出他的编程技术、博客文笔都是出类拔萃的，而这，都是值得学习，进而提升自己的。

>在过去的 2019 年里，我读完了 63 本书，这是一项全新的个人记录：

![](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/2020/chart-books-read.svg)

I began keeping detailed track of my reading when this blog launched in 2003. In case you're wondering, the total count since 2003 is just a bit over 700, though this overcounts by 10-15% if we consider unique books, since I re-read books quite a bit (more on this later).
>当这个博客在 2003 年上线时开始，我就详细记录了我的阅读情况。如果你想知道，从 2003 年开始，我一共阅读了超过 700 本书，如果考虑书的唯一性，这个数字还会再提升 10-15%，因为我重读了很多书（稍后我会更详细地介绍）。

This seemed like a good time to reflect and also answer some frequently asked questions I get from followers about my reading habits.
>这似乎是一个很好的反思和回答粉丝提给我的阅读习惯问题的时机，

Reading books is an important part of my life. Reading a good book is an activity I enjoy on a profound level. It's not just for passing time; it's for gaining a deeper understanding of the world we inhabit, and for shaping my own view of myself and my place in this world. Therefore, the effort to find good books to read is never-ending, and over the years my summaries have helped many people fill up their own reading queues - very happy to help!
>读书是我生活中重要的一部分。读书是让我非常享受的一个活动。这不仅仅是为了打发时间；还是为了更深入地了解我们所在的世界，也是为了塑造我自己对自己和我在这个世界的认知。因此，努力寻找好书来阅读是永无止境的，多年来，我的总结帮助很多人填满他们自己的阅读计划 —— 非常乐意提供帮助！

I get _many_ questions from followers about my reading habits. Here's a bit of Q&A. The first question is by far the most common, but others come up quite a bit as well.
>我收到了_很多_粉丝的关于我的阅读习惯的提问。下面是一些问答环节。第一个问题是最多人问的，其他问题问的人也不少。

Q: How do you find time to read so much?
>问：你怎么有时间读这么多书？

A: I make time.
>答：我挤出时间。

It's as simple as that. When people ask me this question, I always feel tempted to ask back "Why do you think you don't have time?". I'm convinced that anyone can find time if they really want it; it's just a matter of priorities.
>就这么简单。当人们问我这个问题时，我总是反问他们：“你为什么觉得自己没时间？”，我相信，如果真的想要时间，任何人都能找到时间；这只是优先考虑的问题。

I feel compelled to add that I don't see myself as any sort of record-breaking reader. There are many people who read way more than me, both in terms of quantity and quality. I still have much to learn about time management.
>我不得不补充一点，我认为自己不是那种打破记录的读者。很多人的阅读量和质量都比我多。关于时间管理，我还有很多需要学习的。

A more detailed answer is due, though. It's a combination of several factors:
>不过，我有必要回答得更详细些。以下是一些因素的结合：

1.Audiobooks: these make up a sizable chunk (at least a third) of my reading in the past few years. I can carve up a lot of reading time while commuting, working out, waiting at my kids' after-school activities, washing dishes and doing other chores around the house. Over an hour a day spent on all these combined is not uncommon. At 1.25x listening speed, I can burn through an average-sized book in a couple of weeks.
>1.有声读物：在我过去几年的阅读中，有声读物占了很大的比重（至少1/3）。我可以在上下班、锻炼、等孩子放学后的活动、洗碗和其他家务时挤出很多阅读时间。每天花一个多小时在这上面是很常见的。以 1.25 倍的速度去听音频，我可以在几周之内听完一本普通厚的书。

2.Making time: I find that I have some free time almost every evening to relax; it's usually not much, maybe 30-45 minutes. Rather than watching TV or browsing social media, I read. I also spend some of my working time reading technical books; when I'm really into a technical book, this can amount to 20-30 minutes a day. Each instance in isolation is not much, but it really adds up over time.
>2.挤出时间：我发现，我几乎每天晚上都有一些空闲时间来放松，通常不会太多，大概 30-40 分钟。这段时间，我会来阅读，而不是看电视或浏览社交媒体。我也会花一些工作时间阅读技术书籍；如果我真的很喜欢一本技术书籍，我会每天花 20-30 分钟来看。单个的一段空闲时间可能并不长，但随着时间的推移，它们会日积月累，读的东西就越来越多。

This is the place to mention that I prefer consuming slow media, to the extent possible. I should really write a longer blog post about this topic alone, but in the context of reading slow media means I prefer books to articles, magazines and blog posts. These, in turn, I prefer over social media. Therefore, given that I spend some small chunk of my day reading - meaning scanning text with my eyes - I strongly prefer this time to be spent on books rather than any other text organization format.
>这里要提到的是，我喜欢尽可能地使用慢速多媒体。关于这个话题，我真应该单独写一篇更长的博文，但在阅读慢媒体的背景下，我更喜欢书籍而不是文章、杂志和博文文章。是的，相对于社交媒体，我更喜欢这些。因此我会考虑到我每天会花一小段时间阅读 —— 也就是用眼睛扫描文本 —— 我强烈希望把这段时间花在书本上，而不是其他的文本载体。

3.Reading with my kids: this one is fairly new, from the last year or so. As my kids grow older, I find that I can read books together with them that both of us actually enjoy. There are a couple of instances of that in the [most recent reading summary](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2019/summary-of-reading-october-december-2019/). This is just like audiobooks in a way - it allows me to "steal" reading time while doing something else. Reading together with my kids is a lot of fun, and it combines an activity that's dear to my heart (spending quality time with them) with another activity - reading. I actually find that some "young reader" versions of books are better than adult books! They convey very similar amounts of information in a shorter, clearer way, without spending text on useless embellishments and trying to pad to 300 pages.
>3.和我的孩子一起阅读：这是一个相当新的方法，从去年开始的。随着我孩子的成长，我发现我可以和他们一起读我们都喜欢的书籍。在[最近的阅读总结](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2019/summary-of-reading-october-december-2019/)中就有一些这样的例子。在某种程度上，就像有声读物 —— 它让我在做其他事情的同时“偷”时间阅读。和我的孩子一起阅读是一件有趣的事，它结合了一项我非常喜欢的活动（和他们一起度过宝贵的时间）和另一项活动 —— 阅读。事实上，我发现一些适合于“年轻读者”版本的书也很有价值之处！它们以更短、更清晰的方式传达了差不多的信息量，而无需花费大量的文字做额外的修饰，也没有试图把篇幅补全到 300 页。

Q: Do you read paper books? Audiobooks? Ebooks?
>问：你阅读纸质书、音频书、电子书吗？

A: Short answer: yes.
>答：简单的说，是的。

For audiobooks, see the answer above. The rest is split between ebooks and paper books. My heuristic here is pretty clear: I prefer an ebook, unless it's a book that has graphics (like images, photos or charts), equations or code in it. I read ebooks on a Kindle, and I don't like how Kindles do images, equations or code. But I do prefer them for pure-text books, because a Kindle is lighter, easier to hold with one hand, and easier to put down (in the sense that it's easier to find where you left off).
>有声读物，可以参考上面的回答。其余部分则被电子书和纸质书瓜分。我的感受很清楚：相比于其他，我更喜欢电子书，除非那本书上带有图形（比如图片、照片或图表）、方程或代码。我在 Kindle 上阅读电子书，但我不太喜欢 Kindle 上的显示的图片、方程或代码。但对于纯文本的书，我确实更喜欢电子书，因为 Kindle 更轻量，便于一只手拿着，也更容易携带（在某种程度上，当你把它落在某处，你更容易找到它）。

Q: Do you speed-read?
>问：你速读吗？

A: No. I experimented a little bit with speed-reading [many years ago](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2006/10/02/speed-reading), but never really warmed up to it. I did manage to bring my WPM much higher, but comprehension suffered, and I also found I enjoy reading less. Lately, the vast majority of my reading is non-fiction, which makes speed-reading even more challenging, because comprehension is crucial. I'd say I read physical books at a pretty average pace now.
>答：不。

As for audiobooks, I set them to 1.25x because the original speed is unbearably slow, but this is not fast by any means. Most folks I know listen at 1.25x at least, and some listen at much faster - like 1.5x or 2x. I found these higher speeds harder to concentrate with, and comprehension suffers greatly. So I settled for a more moderate pace.

Q: Do you re-read books?

A: Absolutely. I also group them separately in my reading summaries, so it's easy to see which books are re-reads. I estimate that about 10-15% of the books I've been reading recently fall into this category. I've read many books twice, and some books three or more times.

Re-reading good books is very important for me. [A while ago](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2007/05/15/quality-reading-instead-of-quantity-reading) I made a resolution to read more for quality than quantity, but this is easier said then done. Yes, most of my reading is non-fiction, and I spend quite a bit of time vetting books before I read them. But the most effective way to keep average quality up is to re-read books I found great.

How often does it happen that I re-read a book and find almost nothing new in it? Almost never. Keep in mind that some books are a distillation of many years of an author's diligent research and writing work; it's very unlikely to "get" all of it in just a few hours. Reading a book and letting the material simmer in the back of your mind for some period (a year or more, typically), and then re-reading is a very effective way to extract more information.

Q: Do you always finish a book before starting the next one?

A: I always have more than one book in progress - one on audio and another in text. But usually it's even more than one. For example, there is a technical book I'm slowly plowing through only at certain times (when concentration is easiest), and quite often if I'm reading something "heavy" I'll put it aside for a while and read a lighter book. I also have at least one book "in progress" going with my kids at any given time. So the average is probably around 4.

The question is also sometimes asked in the sense of "do you finish all the books you begin". Well, not always, but almost. I try to vet books very carefully before reading them, so I don't get duds often. But every once in a while I do, and then I have no issue abandoning a particularly bad book in the middle.
